@article{Mersmann1990,
	Abstract = {In this research work, the gradient theory (GT) of inhomogeneous fluids was used to calculate interracial tensions (IFTs). The correlations of the influence parameter are presented for pure hydrocarbons, which can improve the scaling behavior of pure fluids under near-critical conditions. The overall average absolute deviations (AADs) of the calculated IFTs from the GT model with the SRK, PR and PT equations of state (EOS's) for 86 non-polar and weakly polar pure substances are 2.34\%, 2.10\% and 2.29\%, respectively. At low pressure, the lumping method proposed by Leibovici Leibovici, C.F, 1993. A consistent procedure for the estimation of properties associated to lumped systems. Fluid Phase Equilibria, 87: 89-197 was used to lump a mixture into one pseudocomponent, and its IFFs were calculated by means of the method of pure fluids. On the basis of the SRK EOS, the overall AAD of mixtures was 3.26\% at low pressure, and that of naphtha reformate cuts was 3.6\%. In addition, the gradient theory was used to predict interfacial tensions for binary systems in the near-critical region. The results show excellent agreement between the predicted and experimental IFTs at high and moderate levels, while the agreement is reasonably accurate in the near-critical region as the models reveal classical scaling behavior. To predict low IFTs accurately (or < 0.1 mN m-l), an equation of state with proper scaling behavior in the vicinity of the critical point is at least required.},

@article{Gebauer2008,
	Abstract = {Calcium carbonate forms scales, geological deposits, biominerals, and ocean sediments. Huge amounts of carbon dioxide are retained as carbonate ions, and calcium ions represent a major contribution to water hardness. Despite its relevance, little is known about the precipitation mechanism of calcium carbonate, and specified complex crystal structures challenge the classical view on nucleation considering the formation of metastable ion clusters. We demonstrate that dissolved calcium carbonate in fact contains stable prenucleation ion clusters forming even in undersaturated solution. The cluster formation can be characterized by means of equilibrium thermodynamics, applying a multiple-binding model, which allows for structural preformation. Stable clusters are the relevant species in calcium carbonate nucleation. Such mechanisms may also be important for the crystallization of other minerals.},

@article{Rodriguez-Blanco2011,
	Abstract = {The kinetics and mechanisms of nanoparticulate amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) crystallization to calcite, via vaterite, were studied at a range of environmentally relevant temperatures (7.5-25 $\,^{\circ}$C) using synchrotron-based in situ time-resolved Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (ED-XRD) in conjunction with high-resolution electron microscopy, ex situ X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. The crystallization process occurs in two stages; firstly, the particles of ACC rapidly dehydrate and crystallize to form individual particles of vaterite; secondly, the vaterite transforms to calcite via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism with the reaction rate controlled by the surface area of calcite. The second stage of the reaction is approximately 10 times slower than the first. Activation energies of calcite nucleation and crystallization are 73$\pm$10 and 66$\pm$2 kJ mol(-1), respectively. A model to calculate the degree of calcite crystallization from ACC at environmentally relevant temperatures (7.5-40 $\,^{\circ}$C) is also presented.},

@article{Lifshitz1961,
	Abstract = {An analysis is made of the process whereby diffusion effects can cause the precipitation of grains of a second phase in a supersaturated solid solution. The kinetics of this type of grain growth are examined in detail. Some grains grow, only to be later dissolved; others increase in size and incorporate further grains that they encounter in so doing. This latter phenomenon of coalescence is discussed in a new "kinetic" approximation. Formulae are given for the asymptotic grain size distribution, for the number of grains per unit volume and for the supersaturation as a function of time. The effects of anisotropy, strain, crystalline order and the finite size of the specimen are allowed for. It is pointed out that for a material that can be said to be "supersaturated with vacancies", the discussion can be applied to the vacancies as solute "atoms" which cluster together to form internal cavities. The practical case of a real, finite crystal is here important, because the vacancies can in general also escape to the surface. A special analysis is made of this example, and the results are applied to the theory of sintering.},

	Abstract = {Experiments were carried out to study the precipitation of calcium carbonate resulting from the mixing of aqueous solutions of calcium nitrate and sodium carbonate in a continous-flow crystallizer at 25-degrees-C in the pH range 8.5 to 10.5, reagent concentration 0.025 to 0.2 mol/l and solution residence times of 5 to 20 min. The population balance model is used to estimate nucleation, growth and agglomeration rates. Under the conditions studied, agglomeration of individual, previously formed crystals largely determines particle size and at higher reagent concentrations results in a bimodal distribution. The crystal form depends on the concentration of reagents, pH and residence time.},

The theory separates those aspects of the nucleation process that are inherently kinetic from those that are inherently thermodynamic. The supposition that an expression for the crystal nucleation rate can be adopted ``by analogy'' to vapor condensation is unnecessary in this theory and is shown to be incorrect. In order to compare experimental data on the total number of particles after a rapid precipitation with our rate expression, we have used a computer model which combines the present theory for nucleation, the theory for crystal growth developed in the previous paper (1) with the concept of Ostwald ripening, and a population balance model. Good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results is obtained.},

General expressions for the induction time and the critical supersaturation ratio for crystallization are given.

	Abstract = {A general thermodynamic relation is proved to exist between the nucleation work and the nucleus size regardless of the model for the excess free energy of the nucleus. When this energy is supersaturation independent, the relation reads as follows: the number of atoms (or molecules) in the nucleus equals the derivative with minus sign of the nucleation work with respect to the supersaturation $\Delta$$\mu$. It is shown that, experimentally, a reliable determination of the nucleus size is possible when data for the stationary nucleation rate J are plotted in coordinates kT ln J vs. $\Delta$$\mu$ (k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature). The slope of such an experimental curve gives information about the nucleus size independently of the kind of nucleation: classical or atomistic, homogeneous or heterogeneous, three dimensional or two dimensional, etc.},

	Abstract = {The kinetics of precipitation of vaterite (CaCO3) from aqueous solution between about 10 and 45$\,^{\circ}$C and at ionic strengths from 15mM to 315mM was determined by recording pH as a function of time and analysing these data by a BASIC computer program, correcting for complexes and using activity coefficients. The particles were spherulites with diameters less than 5 $\mu$m, and the growth kinetics parabolic, with the rate constants (dr/dt)/(S-1)2 equal to 0.180, 0.468, 0.560, 1.250 and 1.860 nm/s at 11.4, 21.7, 25.0, 33.8 and 42.5$\,^{\circ}$C, respectively, and 0.560, 0.588, 0.594 and 0.610 nm/s at ionic strengths 15mM, 65mM, 115mM and 315mM, respectively. The change with temperature corresponds to the activation energy, 57.1 kJ/mol. It is shown that the rate constants found are in quantitative agreement with those calculated from the theory of growth of electrolyte crystals from aqueous solution. This means that the rate-determining mechanism is the release of water molecules from the calcium ions as they ``jump'' into lattice positions.},

	Abstract = {A new derivation is presented for the last stage of phase separation in the kinetics of a first order phase transition, precipitation, where Ostwald ripening is the dominant mechanism. We use a time scaling technique and derive the power law time dependence and distribution function for the size of the particles of the new phase. Equations are derived for the correction terms to the distribution function and power laws. The derivation clarifies and corrects prior work.},

	Abstract = {The wettability of calcium carbonate, an important parameter in the evaluation of the interaction characteristics of materials used in conservation, was examined by measurements with the Wilhelmy plate technique. Heterogeneous surfaces consisting of glass and calcium carbonate were examined. Stable calcium carbonate layers were deposited on microscope glass slides using supersaturated solutions in which the equimolar concentrations of total calcium and total carbonate used ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 M, over a pH range between 9 and 12 and temperature between 25 and 80$\,^{\circ}$C. In all cases amorphous calcium carbonate was deposited, the extent of surface coverage increasing with increasing supersaturation and temperature. Higher surface coverage of the glass slides with calcium carbonate yielded lower contact angles suggesting increased wettability of the heterogeneous surface.},

@article{Voorhees1985,
	Abstract = {Developments in the theory of Ostwald ripening since the classic work of I. M. Lifshitz and V. V. Slyozov (LS) are reviewed and directions for future work are suggested. Recent theoretical work on the role of a finite volume fraction of coarsening phase on the ripening behavior of two-phase systems is reformulated in terms of a consistent set of notation through which each of the theories can be compared and contrasted. Although more theoretical work is necessary, these theories are in general agreement on the effects of a finite volume fraction of coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems. New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime. The conditions responsible for the presence of the asymptotic state first discovered by LS, as well as the manner in which this state is approached, are also discussed. The role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is reviewed, and it is shown that these fields can play a dominant role in determining the coarsening behavior of a solid-solid system.},
